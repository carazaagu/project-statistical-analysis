# Project 5: Football Analytics

Ready? üöÄ
We are Javier Alvarez and Carlos Azagra.
We are super fans not only of football but also at playing at it in videogames. We are very interested in interpretate football information with all the technical knowledge learnt during the course, and we found a dataset with big tons of stats about the most famous football videogame in the history: FIFA.
This dataset combines real data from football players (name, shirt number, teams, salaries, biological information...) and virtual data (subjective data such as rating and skills) that we will use to analyse certain statements or predetermined ideas that we, the fans of football, have, and compare them to real data.
Moreover, we have obtained data from a website about real stats of some of the players from the FIFA dataset in the real life, that we think can help us to test if the virtual data fits or matches real performance of the players.


Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è
‚Ä¢	Player number : The player who wears the jersey with the number 10 uses to be the VIP of the team. The number is related to a set of skills that makes this person not only a relevant player for the team but also a very important economic asset. 
‚Ä¢	Skills: 
o	FIFA divides the skills of the players into 5 main groups: Pace, Passing, Dribbling, Defending and Physic. There is a say in Football... What matter is that the balls gets into the goal.
o	We have also grouped the players according to the main position groups and performed an analysis of how the aforementioned skills perform in each of them.
‚Ä¢	Leagues: The idea behind this study would be how much do the teams invest in their teams by paying wages, how this affect the values of the teams and check if it has a direct effect on the performance rate. Are there differences between the teams or, more importantly, leagues? Are the teams being profitable?

Information üìñ
For this project we have used information from both Sofascore and a dataset with fifa data.
